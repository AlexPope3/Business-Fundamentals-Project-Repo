The graph above shows the average run play scoring change by direction in the red zone (last 20 yards of opponents end of the field where most points are scored). This area of the field is broken into 5 yard bins, with the orange bar chart showing the average scoring chance according to the offensive lineman that the ball is run behind. The blue bar chart shows the frequency of each of the run plays. The takeaway here is that between the 5 and 10 yard line in the redzone, teams run the ball most frequently behind the center even though the left end is the most optimal direction according to the scoring chance. This graph represents a key trend to indicate that NFL offensives in general don't run the most optimal running plays in the redzone.
