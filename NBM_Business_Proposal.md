Business Fundamentals Proposal

Questions/need:
Offensive play calling in the NFL is an increasingly difficult task as defenses continue to become more complex. I’m proposing to build a model that would aid in the high stakes decision making involved in calling offensive plays. 

Benefit of analysis: 
All NFL offenses would benefit from being able to reply on an analytical source to consider in their decision making. Specifically, NFL offensive coordinators could use this model to help validate their play calling in high stake scenarios at key moments during games. Depending on field position and game scenario, the model would help determine the play call with the highest probable success. Decision making processes off the field could benefit from such a model as well; the legal betting community could place wagers with greater levels of confidence on teams who successfully use a play calling model during games. 

Data Description:

•	I plan to use play-by-play data from the 2019 and 2020 NFL seasons. The model would be trained with historical play by play data with variables including time on the game clock at the moment the play starts, play type, play direction, and pre-snap formation. A unit of analysis will be the number of yards gained on a pass or run play. Depending on field position, a successful play will be defined by the number of yards gained or whether points were scored. Yards and point scored are also the targets. 

Tools:

•	I will perform explanatory data analysis in Google sheets and will visualize the results using Tableau. Currently I am not planning to use additional tools beyond those required. 

MVP:

•	An MVP would include the results from the preliminary EDA along with a recommendation as to the appropriate type of predictive model for this forecasting.
